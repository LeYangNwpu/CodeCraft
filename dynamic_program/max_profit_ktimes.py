Problem:
    Maximum profit by buying and selling a share at most k times
Ways:
    considering former problems, buy ans sell at 1 time, 2 times and multiple times
    this problem should be solved using dynamic programming:
    for all j in range [0, i-1]
	    profit[t][i] = max(profit[t][i-1], max(price[i] â€“ price[j] + profit[t-1][j]))

k = 3
profit = max_profit_ktimes(price, k)
print(profit)
