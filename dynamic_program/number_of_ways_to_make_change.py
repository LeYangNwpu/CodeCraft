Problem:
    Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents,
    and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
    how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter
Ways:
    way1: dynamic program
        two properties of DP problem: (1) overlapping sub-problem;(2)optima sub-structure
        we can divide solutions into two sets: 
            not contain mth coin, contain at least one mth conin
        table[icha][jcoin] = table[icha][jcoin-1] + table[icha-coin_j][jcoin]
        construct the table from top to bottom, left to right
    way2: optimize the way1 DP solution
    way3: recursion solution
